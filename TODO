Before 1.0
 * make optional info banner (this seems to work)

After 1.0
 * review the code and make it less hackish
 * re-factor the items
  * see BasicItem somewhere on my hard disk :)
  * re-implement hildon applications for that
 * at the start we should have at least one button: that activates configuration dialog
 * add possibility to start CLI apps
 * add possibility to start control panel applets
 * make icons configurable
 * bookmarks as items
 * special applets:
    * list of recently run applications (configurable list size?)
    * device locking
    * toggling offline mode
    * establish connection to the specified IAP

Non-planned
 * show a note in postinst about activating the applet
    * must only be done if a fresh installation is performed
 * during first start populate the toolbar with existing pre-defined applications
