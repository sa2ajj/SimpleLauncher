Before 1.0
 * make button size configurable (small/big)
 * transparency
 * make optional info banner

After 1.0
 * review the code and make it less hackish
 * re-factor the items
	* see BasicItem somewhere on my hard disk :)
  * re-implement hildon applications for that
 * at the start we should have at least one button: that activates configuration dialog
 * add possibility to start CLI apps
 * add possibility to start control panel applets
 * make icons configurable
 * bookmarks as items

Non-planned
 * show a note in postinst about activating the applet
		* must only be done if a fresh installation is performed
 * during first start populate the toolbar with existing pre-defined applications
